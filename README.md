# Worlds_Hardest_Game
This code is a simple game where the player controls a beach ball using arrow keys to navigate through walls while avoiding three moving fish. The ball bounces off walls and edges, and if it touches a fish, it resets to the starting position, incrementing a "death" counter. The goal is to reach a specific wall to win the game, all while background music plays. The fish continuously move across the screen, creating a dynamic obstacle for the player. The libraries were imported through a website called code.org, and cannot be compiled without them. This project demonstrates my understanding of basic game development concepts, such as sprite creation, animation, collision detection, and player input handling. It also shows my ability to use JavaScript and a game development library to create interactive experiences. This game is also inspired by The World's Hardest Game, known for its challenging navigation and precise timing. Synchronizing the animations of the fish and integrating background music without disrupting gameplay also added layers of complexity. Despite these challenges, developing the game was a rewarding process that paid homage to the intense difficulty of the original.
